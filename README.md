<h3>🚀 About Me</h3>

🎓 I'm a Computer Science undergrad on a mission to build, break, and learn through code.

🌐 Crafting dynamic, user-centric web applications with the MERN Stack and Next.js.

💡 I love solving problems that I find interesting, whether that means building a web app for a business idea or creating custom software for games like Genshin Impact.

💻 Honing my problem-solving skills with Java, Python, & DSA to build a strong logical foundation.

✍️ I bring a narrative-driven approach to development, a skill I sharpen through my creative writing as Ashen Everwrite.

<h3>✍️ Building in Public: My Blog</h3>

I believe in the power of sharing the journey. On my blog, writing as Radhesh, I'll document my process—from technical deep-dives on my projects to the lessons I learn on my entrepreneurial path. My first article is in the works, stay tuned!

✨ Beyond the Code: Storytelling & Strategy

While my professional and technical writing is under my own name, I explore fiction and poetry under my creative pseudonym, Ashen Everwrite. This isn't just a hobby—it's my training ground for thinking about the bigger picture.

🧠 This creative outlet helps me approach development with a focus on user experience, product narrative, and business strategy.

🌌 Analyzing narrative design in games and books inspires both my creative and technical projects.
