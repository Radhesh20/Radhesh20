<h3>🚀 About Me</h3>

🎓 I'm a Computer Science undergrad on a mission to build, break, and learn through code.

🌐 Crafting dynamic, user-centric web applications with the MERN Stack and Next.js.

💡 I love solving problems that I find interesting, whether that means building a web app for a business idea or creating custom software for games like Genshin Impact.

💻 Honing my problem-solving skills with Java + DSA to build a strong logical foundation.

✍️ As a script and story writer (Ashen Everwrite), I bring a narrative-driven approach to development, focusing on user journeys and compelling experiences.

<h3>✍️ My Blog & Writing</h3>

I believe writing clarifies thinking and is a powerful way to share knowledge. I'm currently working on articles about my journey in tech, my approach to problem-solving, and the intersection of storytelling and development. Stay tuned for my first post!

✨ Beyond the Code: Storytelling & Strategy

My passion for writing isn't just a hobby—it's my training ground for thinking about the bigger picture.

📝 As Ashen Everwrite, I write scripts and stories, diving deep into sci-fi and fantasy worlds.

🧠 This creative outlet helps me approach development with a focus on user experience, product narrative, and business strategy.

🌌 Analyzing narrative design in games and books inspires both my creative and technical projects.
