<h3>🚀 About Me</h3>

🎓 I'm a Computer Science undergrad on a mission to build, break, and learn through code.

🌐 Crafting dynamic, user-centric web applications with the MERN Stack and Next.js.

💡 I love solving problems that I find interesting, whether that means building a web app for a business idea or creating custom software for games like Genshin Impact.

💻 Honing my problem-solving skills with Java + DSA to build a strong logical foundation.

✍️ As a script and story writer (Ashen Everwrite), I bring a narrative-driven approach to development, focusing on user journeys and compelling experiences.
